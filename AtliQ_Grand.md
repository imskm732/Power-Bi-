# 🏨 AtliQ Grands – Business Intelligence Dashboard

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been operating in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years.  
Due to strategic moves from competitors and ineffective decision-making, AtliQ Grands has been losing market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotels category.

As a strategic move, the managing director wanted to incorporate **Business and Data Intelligence** to regain their market position.  
However, the company does not have an in-house analytics team to generate insights.

To solve this, the revenue management team decided to hire a third-party service provider to extract meaningful insights from historical data.
